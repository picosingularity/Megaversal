            <h1>Techno-Wizard O.C.C.</h1>
            <p>
                By Kevin Siembieda & Carmen Bellaire
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tcchno-Wizard (TW) is the most unconventional of the magic Occupational Character Classes. They are men of magic who have learned to combine magic with technology. Although the Tcchno-Wizard can cast spells and read scrolls, the focus of their magic
                is the creation of magic devices. The mage has learned to direct his potential psychic energies into machines, enabling those devices to do strange and magical things that seem to defy known science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of these devices seem to only emulate existing magic and psionic abilities, however, they offer several advantages. One advantage is that unlike a spell that can only be spun by a person knowledgeable in magic, or a psionic power that can only be
                utilized by the psychic who possesses it, many devices created and empowered by Techno-Wizardry can be used by anyone who has sufficient psychic or magic energy (P.P.E. or I.S.P.). This means a fellow practitioner of magic or a psychic
                can use a Techno-Wizard's machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another advantage is that people who are not psychic or mystically oriented can NOT operate the device at all. Sort of a built-in safety feature that keeps the item out of the hands of ordinary people. <b>For Example:</b> Somebody who
                is not a mage or psychic cannot fly a Wing Board or operate a TK-Machine-Gun. In fact, to a normal person, the devices seem like worthless junk without any apparent power source or functioning internal workings. They do not realize that
                the operator of the device himself is the power source! Techno-Wizards have taken the concept of a practitioner of magic being a <i>living battery</i> of Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.) to its logical conclusion (or so it seems to them).
                Thus, they create devices that are powered by the individual user's own energy and directed by the person's thoughts and willpower. The need for other energy sources is greatly reduced (not quite completely eliminated).
            </p>
            <p>
                A third advantage to using P.P.E. as a means to power devices is that they are non-polluting, non-toxic, odorless (except to Psi-Stalkers, Dog Boys, and supernatural creatures), and have no known ill effects on human life.
            </p>
            <p>
                A fourth advantage is that the devices arc usually easy to conceal and do not often appear to be magical. Whenever the device is not in use. it does not radiate magic, because it is not currently empowered by magic. It probably also appears to be nothing
                more than a construct of machine parts, gems, wires and chewing gum.

            <h2>Techno-Wizard O.C.C. Psionic Powers</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1. The Techno-Wizard Has the Following Psionic Powers:</b> Machine Ghost (12), Mind Block (4), Object Read (6), Speed Reading (2), Telemechanics (10), and Total Recall (2).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. I.S.P. Base:</b> Roll 4D6 plus the character's M.E. number to determine the base Inner Strength Points. The Techno-Wizard is considered a Minor Psychic so he or she receives another 1D4+1 I.S.P. per each additional level of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Saving Throw Versus Psionic Attack:</b> As a Minor Psychic, the character needs a 12 or higher to save vs psionics.
            </p>
            <h2>Techno-Wizard O.C.C. Magic Powers</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1. Initial Spell Knowledge & Spell Casting:</b> In addition to his Techno-Wizardry powers. The character has a solid understanding of spell magic and how to tap into Ley Lines and nexus points for additional P.P.E. <u>Starts with the following spells:</u>                Armor of Ithan (10), Blinding Flash (1), Breathe Without Air (5), Call Lightning (15), Cloak of Darkness (6), Deflect (10), Electric Arc (8), Energy Bolt (5), Energy Field (10), Fire Ball (10), Fire Bolt (7), Fuel Flame (5), Fly (15),
                Forcebonds (25), Globe of Daylight (2), Ignite Fire (6), Impervious to Energy (20). Impervious to Fire (5), Magic Net (7), Magic Shield (6), See the Invisible (4), Sense Magic (4), Shadow Meld (10), Superhuman Strength (10) and Telekinesis
                (8).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Other spells can be used to create other devices. <b>For Example:</b> Invisibility: Superior can be used to create a vehicle or suit of armor that can turn invisible.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Spell Casting.</b> The Techno-W izard is <i>not</i> the master of spell magic the Ley Line Walker and Shifter are, but is still pretty capable. It is not a lack of understanding in magic that limits the Techno-Wizard's spell casting
                abilitics, but his orientation. That orientation is magic used in conjunction with machines. Consequently, his spell casting abilities are not the same as other spell casters. Instead of spell casting with a mere word and a gesture. the
                Techno-Wizard needs an appropriate mechanical device through which to concentrate his thoughts and focus his spell. <u>For Example:</u> If a Ley Line Walker needs to cast a simple <i>Fire Bolt</i> spell, all that is required is speaking
                a few words and pointing at his target. For the machine oriented Techno-Wizard, he needs a device as his <i>delivery system</i>. That device could be a C-18 Laser Pistol or an ordinary revolver, or one of his own, weird devices. He points
                his pistol at the target, whispers a few words and his Fire Bolt spell erupts from the pistol. Later he could use the same pistol to fire its normal laser beam (or bullet or whatever) again. Using a <i>piece of technology</i> as his spell
                focus does not harm the object in any way, it simply becomes the temporary conduit through which he channels his focus and energy. Once the spell has ended, the device is as non-magical as it was before casting the spell. Only full Techno-Wizardry
                conversion permanently adds magical capabilities to a device. <i>See Techno-Wizardry Construction</i>. <b>Note:</b> The Techno-Wizard cannot fire the pistol (laser or bullet) and a magic spell at the same time, it has to be one or the
                other.
            </p>
            <p>
                What the device is. and how it functions, also makes a difference. To fire the Fire Bolt he needed a mechanism like a gun because it was a logical energy ( or bullet) firing machine to begin with. It shoots, so it can fire his magic spell. Get the idea?
                So if the Techno-Wizard wanted to cast <i>See the Invisible</i>, he could NOT use a gun, because it docsn 't make sense. He would need some type of binoculars, goggles, glasses or optic system to focus his spell through
                for him to See the Invisible with the item.
            </p>
            <p>
                All Techno-Wizard spells must be cast in this manner, failure to do so means suffering the spell casting penalty for not having an appropriate focus. <b>Spell Casting Penalty:</b> All spell ranges, durations, M.D.C./S.D.C. and damage are
                reduced by half when cast through traditional words and gestures, rather than refocused through a mechanical device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Learning New Spells:</b> A Techno-Wizard is primarily interested in energy spells needed to create and power mystic devices. The mage spends much of his time building and tinkering with new devices rather than seeking out new spells.
                Additional spells and rituals of any magic level can be learned and or purchased at any time regardless of the Techno-Wizard's experience level (See the <i>Pursuit of Magic</i> in the Spell Section). After energy spells, interest will
                be in <i>physical manipulation</i> that can be applied to devices, such as Invisibility: Simple, Invincible Armor, Teleport: Lesser, Mystic Portal and related spells. The character is not usually interested in other areas of magic and
                <i>never</i> acquires summoning or circle magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. P.P.E.:</b> Like all men of magic, the Techno-Wizard is a living battery of mystic energy and draws on his inner power to create magic.
                <b>Permanent Base P.P.E.:</b> 3D4x10, in addition to the P.E. attribute number. Add 2D6 P.P.E. per each additional level of experience. Of course, the mage can also draw P.P.E. from ley lines, nexus points, and other people whenever available.
                <b>P.P.E. Recovery:</b> For the TechnoWizards, spent P.P.E. recovers at a rate of four points per hour of sleep or rest. Meditation restores P.P.E. at 8 per hour of meditation and is equal to one hour of sleep for this character when it
                comes to recovery from fatigue and physical rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Ley Line Piloting:</b> Techno-Wizards enjoy a sort of intuitive skill knowledge and ability to pilot any TW vehicle designed to go along ley lines with astounding skill, even if they normally have no piloting skill whatsoever. <u>For Example:</u>                A Techno-Wizard without a Pilot Airplane skill can pilot a TK-Flyer or Wing Board like a pro, but he wouldn't even consider flying an ordinary airplane. This natural aptitude with "ley line vehicles" (TW vehicles designed to fly along
                ley lines) comes from the Techno-Wizard's link to TW devices and magic energy.<b>Techno-Wizard Base Piloting Skill:</b> Applies to all Icy line guided vehicles: 74% +2% per level of experience. All other mages, Ley Linc Walkers and psychics
                must have the appropriate piloting skill for that type of vehicle or they can <i>NOT</i> operate the TW version ( e.g., needs Pilot Airplane to fly a plane-like TW vehicle, Pilot Automobile to drive a TW car, etc.). Wing Boards arc the
                only exception, anybody can fly one with a little practice (74% +2% per level of experience). Only the Ley Line Walker with his affinity with ley lines gets a+ 10% bonus to pilot a TW ley line vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Magic Bonuses:</b> +2 to save vs Horror Factor, +2 to save vs possession and mind control, +1 to save vs magic at levels 3, 7, IO and 13, +1 to Spell Strength (the number others must save against when you cast a spell) at levels
                4, 8, and 12. +3 on Perception Rolls that involve magic or machines or their combination.
