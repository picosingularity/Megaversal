    <h1>Techno-Wizard O.C.C.</h1>
    <p>By Kevin Siembieda & Carmen Bellaire</p>
    <p>The Tcchno-Wizard (TW) is the most unconventional of the magic Occupational Character Classes. They are men of magic who have learned to combine magic with technology. Although the Tcchno-Wizard can cast spells and read scrolls, the focus of their
        magic is the creation of magic devices. The mage has learned to direct his potential psychic energies into machines, enabling those devices to do strange and magical things that seem to defy known science. Many of these devices seem to only emulate
        existing magic and psionic abilities, however, they offer several advantages. One advantage is that unlike a spell that can only be spun by a person knowledgeable in magic, or a psionic power that can only be utilized by the psychic who possesses
        it, many devices created and empowered by Techno-Wizardry can be used by anyone who has sufficient psychic or magic energy (P.P.E. or I.S.P.). This means a fellow practitioner of magic or a psychic can use a Techno-Wizard's machine. Another advantage
        is that people who are not psychic or mystically oriented can NOT operate the device at all. Sort of a built-in safety feature that keeps the item out of the hands of ordinary people. For Example: Somebody who is not a mage or psychic cannot fly
        a Wing Board or operate a TK-Machine-Gun. In fact, to a normal person, the devices seem like worthless junk without any apparent power source or functioning internal workings. They do not realize that the operator of the device himself is the
        power source! Techno-Wizards have taken the concept of a practitioner of magic being a living battery of Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.) to its logical conclusion (or so it seems to them). Thus, they create devices that are powered by the individual
        user's own energy and directed by the person's thoughts and willpower. The need for other energy sources is greatly reduced (not quite completely eliminated). A third advantage to using P.P.E. as a means to power devices is that they are non-polluting,
        non-toxic, odorless (except to Psi-Stalkers, Dog Boys, and supernatural creatures), and have no known ill effects on human life. A fourth advantage is that the devices arc usually easy to conceal and do not often appear to be magical. Whenever
        the device is not in use. it does not radiate magic, because it is not currently empowered by magic. It probably also appears to be nothing more than a construct of machine parts, gems, wires and chewing gum.</p>
